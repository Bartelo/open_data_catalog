            <h3>Projects built in Boston &mdash; for Boston.</h3>
            <p>Linking community members and software developers to strengthen Boston. Build:Boston is a place where the public and government can solve problems together. Have a specific project you’d like some help with? You’ve come the the right place, here you can propose a project!</p>
            <p>This is pre-alpha software! Build:Boston and Datacouch are still being built and tested. How it works, decide what problems lend themselves to projects developing content, share you story and post the project, and get involed in other projects.</p>

            <h3>Lend your skillset</h3>
            <p>This is a data platform where we can put ideas, data, and applications together while allowing people to collaborate and create in a communal online space. Projects are a great way to engage the public to create submissions, increase awareness about a product or program, and encourage participation. A project can take many forms. For example, the government can challenge the public to: develop an app or graphic, improve a product or process, solve a problem previously thought unsolvable</p>

            <h3>Search for existing solutions</h3>
            <p>Why reinvent the wheel, you might not be the only person wit this problem. Perhaps that same problem has already been addressed through an awesome locally built web app and we’d like to share it! Sharing the software you’re building is the best way to ensure that quality remains high and that other can benefit from and contribute to it.</p>
            <p>If you have a potentially shareable application in development or production, let us know. If it’s not already released, we can help you develop plans to share it. If it’s already available, we can help publicize it by adding it to the Commons.</p>
